<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Introduction and objective:</h2>
<p>Wordament is a  one-player puzzle game, where the player</p>
<p>starts with a 4 x 4 grid of letters, that can be dragged together in any path to form a word</p>
<p>The objective of the game is simple: Form as many words as you can to maximize your points</p>
<p>The value of different letters varies and the player can score a different number of points&nbsp;</p>
<p>when they use different letters in their word. Once you start your dragging gesture, a yellow highlight</p>
<p>will follow. It may be helpful to rotate the board from time to time to get a fresh, new perspective on the</p>
<p>on the board.</p>
