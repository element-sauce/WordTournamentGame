# WordTournament 

WordTournament is a  one-player puzzle game, where the player
starts with a 4 x 4 grid of letters, that can be dragged together in any path to form a word.

The objective of the game is simple: Form as many words as you can to maximize your points.
The value of different letters varies and the player can score a different number of points
when they use different letters in their word. Once you start your dragging gesture, a yellow highlight
will follow. It may be helpful to rotate the board from time to time to get a fresh, new perspective on the
on the board.

There are three modes: easy, intermediate, and hard.

Annotations have been made to each Java class explaining its use and design.

The demo video initially shows a test printing to console to demonstrate the possible words that a given board contains,
as it must be a requirement for a board to contain several words determined by the difficulty level. A short demo of finding a word ensues.
